function [acw_0, acw_50, acf, lags] = acw_windowed(x, fs, window, overlap, isplot)
    %% Calculate ACF in windows, average, calculate acw-0 and 50 in averaged ACF
    % Default settings are as in Honey et al 2012 (20 second windows with 50%
    % overlap)
    % Similar to Welch method really
    % Input:
    %   x: Signal (1D vector)
    %   fs: Sampling rate of signal
    %   window: Window size in seconds
    %   overlap: Overlap in percentage (e.g. 50 means 50%)
    %   isplot: Logical argument to plot or not
    % Output:
    %   acw_0, acw_50, acf, lags: Pretty intuitive
    % If you want to use with default settings, use as
    % acw_windowed(x, fs)
